Warning: The allowCypressEnv configuration option is enabled. This allows any browser code to read values from Cypress.env(). This is insecure and will be removed in a future major version.

1. Replace Cypress.env() calls with cy.env() (for sensitive values) or Cypress.expose() (for public configuration)
2. Set allowCypressEnv: false in your Cypress configuration to disable Cypress.env()

Your project does not contain a default supportFile. We expect a file matching cypress/support/e2e.{js,jsx,ts,tsx} to exist.

If a support file is not necessary for your project, set supportFile to false.
